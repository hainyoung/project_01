project 01 : Autonomous Driving

after recording driving videos

Data Extraction
1) from dashboard video : Date, Time, lkas, ldws
2) from front video : Distance
3) from Log files(Application) : Longtitude, Latitude

after extraction data
1) dashboard data, distance data -> check the nulls and remove the duplicates
if it has the nulls -> fill with "interpolate"
if it has the duplicates, remove

2) merge data
dashboard + distance -> according to time

3) merged data(dashboard + distance) + location data(longtitude, latitude)
inner? right?

if location data has the nulls..?
bfill or ffill or interpolate???

4) make a final output data
